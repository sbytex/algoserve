and here the final bash script,,
also I want some changes , like if I get the question wrong I don't want the program to end instead to ask me for re trying,

also when I submit and get it right , I want to wait for few seconds until my tempQ.md is generate and and when done I want to echo parc.js >> tempQ.md

( and is there any way to get the q title name so that I can rename the md to it's questions title. and store my solution from pac.js to tempQ, and tempQ will be then renamed and pushed to my github. and then) tempQ will be removed, as new for round 2.

#!/usr/bin/env bash

while [[ $# > 0 ]]; do
    if [[ $1 == "--dry" ]]; then
        dry="1"
    fi
    shift
done
log() {
    if [[ $dry == "1" ]]; then
        echo "[DRY]: $@"
    else
        echo "$@"
    fi
}
execute() {
    log "executing: $@"
    if [[ $dry == "0" ]]; then
        "$@"
    fi
}
round=0
while [[ true ]]; do
    round=$(($round + 1))
    answer="n"
    read -p "Are you ready (y/n)?" answer
    if [[ $answer != "y" ]]; then
        exit 0
    fi
    sudo log "round $round"
    log "waiting for a submit ..."
    log "also don't get it wrong..."
    if ./leet.js listen; then
        log "great success, looks like you live another day"
    else
        log "you have failed me for the last time"
        log "goodbye"
    fi
done
